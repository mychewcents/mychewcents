ðŸ§‘ Hi! I am Akarsh.

ðŸŽ“ Enroute to being a graduate in Masters of Computing in Infocomm Security (Dec 2021)

ðŸ§³ An Indian in Singapore, with a passion for developing secure and scalable distributed applications and systems.

ðŸ’» Currently, working as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at NUS for the Intro to Information Security module. I collaborate with the professors and other TAs to design and develop project assignments and guidance sessions. Previously, I worked as a Solutions Architect for Coral Blockchain, spearheading their SaaS product design and development, decreasing our client's audit time by 6 months, and boosting their efficiency by 30%. 

ðŸŽ¯ As for my future, I desire to work with a user-facing organization as a Backend Software Developer or DevOps Architect with a distributed and diverse team wearing multiple hats.

ðŸ›¬ Away from work, you would find me exploring new destinations or writing poetry.
